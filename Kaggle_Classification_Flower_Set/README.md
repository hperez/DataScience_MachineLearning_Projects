# Classification Model - Iris Flowers

## Overview
The model aims to classify an Iris flower into one of the three categories.

## Input dataset
This dataset was obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository  
Iris Data Set - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

## Training and Test datasets (Validation dataset)
Input dataset has been divided as - 80% Train and 20% Test (Validation Dataset)

## Algorithms
Different algorithms have been used to compare the output results on the validation dataset.

#### Algorithms used:
1. Logistic Regression (LR)
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. Classification and Regression Trees (CART)
5. Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
6. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Model Accuracy
Accuracy achieved ~ 93% (Support Vector Machine)  
Scoring metric used - "accuracy"
